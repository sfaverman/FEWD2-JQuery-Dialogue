<p>Cripes! You startled me. I wasn’t expecting you here.</p>
<p>It’s been a real day for expectations. Where were you? I’ve been waiting here for an hour. You didn’t leave a note or—</p>
<p>I wasn’t planning on going anywhere—</p>
<p>I can see that. Where’s your coat?</p>
<p>I left the house in a hurry. I… um… my mother…</p>
<p>The hospital reached you? God, I’m sorry. That’s why—</p>
<p>The hospital?</p>
<p>They called me when they couldn’t get you.</p>
<p>I don’t understand.</p>
<p>Your mother. You said —</p>
<p>I ran out to buy some flowers for her. She’s been so down.</p>
<p>For three hours you’ve been buying flowers?</p>
<p>And then I drove around. I’ve had… a lot on my mind. But I’m fine now. Fine.</p>
<p>You didn’t go by the hospital?</p>
<p>No. Look, I’m freezing. Let’s go inside. Why did the hospital call? Does the doctor need my signature for more tests?</p>
<p>We have to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>I’ve had a terrible—</p>
<p>We have to go to the hospital. Now. The rest of your family is already there.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, no. Mom’s all right, isn’t she? Isn't she?</p>
